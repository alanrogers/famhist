<h2>The bible of Robert Walker Carley</h2>

<p>I inherited a bible that once belonged to my great great grandfather,
Robert Walker Carley. He received it from the Church Education Society
for Ireland, as indicated by the <a href="./CarleyPresentation.pdf">sticker</a>
inside the front cover.</p>

<p>Folded up inside the bible were several letters:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="RobtCarley.pdf">Letter from Robert Carley</a> Robert Carley wrote this
letter to his daughter, Margaret Alice, on her 8th birthday,
in 1868. A summary of Carley's life is available
<a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21483199/robert-walker-carley-bio-from-seguin/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="MCarley.pdf">Letter from Fannie Carley</a> I suspect this is a letter
to Margaret Alice Carley from her step-mother, Fannie Lamont Carley</p></li>
<li><p><a href="FromFannieGlass.pdf">Letter from Fannie Glass</a> I suspect this was
sent to my grandmother, Mary Glass. It is dated 1900, when Mary
would have been about 7 years old.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="ToMaryGlass.pdf">Letter to Mary Glass</a> This letter is written on
the back of the one from Fannie Glass and is from someone named
"Myrtle Massy". It says: "Dear Mary, life is long and boys are
[plenty?] and don't get married befour [sic] you are twenty. a true
friend Myrtle Massy". The childish prose and spelling suggest that
Myrtle was a childhood friend of Mary's.</p></li>
</ul>
