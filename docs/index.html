<h2>Letters from the bible of Robert Carley</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="RobtCarley.pdf">Letter from Robert Carley</a> Robert Carley wrote this
letter to his daughter, Margaret Alice, on her 8th birthday.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="FromFannieGlass.pdf">Letter from Fannie Glass</a> I suspect this was
sent to my grandmother, Mary Glass. It is dated 1900, when Mary
would have been about 7 years old.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="ToMaryGlass.pdf">Letter to Mary Glass</a> This letter is written on
the back of the one from Fannie Glass and is from someone named
"Myrtle Massy". It says: "Dear Mary, life is long and boys are
[plenty?] and don't get married befour [sic] you are twenty. a true
friend Myrtle Massy". The childish prose and spelling suggest that
Myrtle was a childhood friend of Mary's.</p></li>
