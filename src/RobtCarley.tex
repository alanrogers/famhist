\title{Letter from Robert Walker Carley to Margaret Alice Carley}
\author{Alan R. Rogers}
\date{14 February 2021}
\maketitle

This document contains a letter that has been folded up inside a bible
that once belonged to Robert Walker Carley, who was born May 22, 1834,
in Ireland and died Aug.\ 5, 1872, in Seguin, Texas, at the age of
38. At the time of his death, Carley was Rector of St.\ Andrews
Episcopal Church. A summary of Carley's life can be found
\href{https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21483199/robert-walker-carley-bio-from-seguin}{here}.

The letter is addressed to ``Alice,'' who was probably his daughter,
Margaret Alice Carley. If I am deciphering the handwriting correctly,
Robert is writing to Alice on her birthday. About half way down the
first page, he writes ``you will want to be very good now as you have
grown so old---now eight years---what a great girl.'' Margaret Alice
was born on April 23, 1860. This letter therefore dates to April,
1868. Although Carley had enrolled in Harvard in 1867, intending to
graduate in 1868, he left the program early and was therefore probably
not there when this letter was written. He asks Alice to give his
``love to the baby.'' This was probably Alice's half-brother, Robert
Walker Carley, Jr., born March 2, 1868, to Robert senior's second
wife, Fannie Lamont.

Margaret Alice married Robert D.\ Glass. My grandmother, Mary Glass
Chamberlain, was one of their many children.

Here is my best effort at a transcription:
\begin{quotation}
  \noindent My dearest Alice,

  I have just [thought?] that this is your birth day, so as I cannot
  be with you to congratulate, I must do what is next best, that is,
  write you a line. You will want to be very good now as you have
  grown so old---now eight years---what a great girl. You will be able
  now to get such perfect lessons, while [or which?] your
  [indecipherable] so big, that your teacher will be very glad
  indeed. And [we?] will all be very glad to [missing] you get on
  nicely, and then [indecipherable] you will go into the common
  school, and that will be something [grand?].

  What fine sunny weather we have. I often wish that I could ask you
  and [Frankie?] [out here?] to enjoy the pleasant sunshine.

  I send you best love and many birth day Kisses.

  Do not forget to be [missing word]. I hope you get along nicely with
  the [indecipherable] and help all you can. [It?] pleases everyone to
  see a little girl [industrious?].

  Give my love to the baby, and give him a Kiss for me.

  It is beautiful to hear the birds sing out here in the woods.

  Your loving father

  \mbox{}\hfill Robert Carley.
