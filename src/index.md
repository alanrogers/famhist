## The bible of Robert Walker Carley

I inherited a bible that once belonged to my great great grandfather,
Robert Walker Carley. He received it from the Church Education Society
for Ireland, as indicated by the [sticker](./CarleyPresentation.pdf)
inside the front cover.

Folded up inside the bible were several letters:

* [Letter from Robert Carley](RobtCarley.pdf) Robert Carley wrote this
  letter to his daughter, Margaret Alice, on her 8th birthday,
  in 1868. A summary of Carley's life is available
  [here][seguin-gazette-enterprise].

* [Letter from Fannie Carley](MCarley.pdf) I suspect this is a letter
  to Margaret Alice Carley from her step-mother, Fannie Lamont Carley

* [Letter from Fannie Glass](FromFannieGlass.pdf) I suspect this was
  sent to my grandmother, Mary Glass. It is dated 1900, when Mary
  would have been about 7 years old.

* [Letter to Mary Glass](ToMaryGlass.pdf) This letter is written on
  the back of the one from Fannie Glass and is from someone named
  "Myrtle Massy". It says: "Dear Mary, life is long and boys are
  [plenty?] and don't get married befour [sic] you are twenty. a true
  friend Myrtle Massy". The childish prose and spelling suggest that
  Myrtle was a childhood friend of Mary's.
